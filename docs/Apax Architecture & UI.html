      <h3><span>1. </span>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Apax is a web application that helps users see statistics about cars
        in the national fleet for the past 5 years. With its help, they can
        follow the flow control of the numbers on different categories.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="database">
      <h3><span>2. </span>Database</h3>
      <p>
        Apax uses a mySQL Database that stores the information available in
        CSV format on the official site of the fleet, found in References (1).
      </p>
      <p>
        The table used for saving and accessing this information is called
        <i>masini</i> and contains attributes such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          judet - describes the name of the county where cars in that
          registration can be found
        </li>
        <li>
          categorie_nationala - describes the national category cars in that
          registration are part of
        </li>
        <li>
          categorie_comunitara - describes the national category cars in that
          registration are part of

      <h3><span>3. </span>API</h3>
      <p>
        Our web application makes use of a Rest API that serves information
        needed from the database mentioned above in JSON format. Mainly, it is
        base on GET requests, which is specific to the description: allows
        users to see statistics. Also, in the case of registering and loging in,
        the implementented services are the POST ones. For more information about the endpoints of
        the API, you can access the API documentation found in References (2).
      </p>
      <p>
        Getting deeper into details, API has two main components named <b>Model API</b> and <b>Controller API</b>. The
        first one
        has the role of querying the proper tables in the database and return data needed by the Controller API. Among
        the functions
        that compose Model API, we can enumerate <i>count_cars_county_brand</i>, <i>count_cars_county_nat_categ</i>,
        <i>count_cars_county_com_categ</i>, each of them used to query the number of cars in a certain county and year
        that are part of a
        brand, national category or communitary category. Along with them, there are also some functions that read the
        name of the brand,
        national category etc. from a certain county (or all) or year (or all). Each of these methods are used by the
        Controller API which takes
        the data and serves it in JSON format to the View Component, better described at <a href="visualisation">Data
          visualisation</a>.

        <h4><span>4.1. </span>Login</h4>
        <p>
          If an user wants to access the website he/she has to login firstly.
          For that, the user has to provide the email and the password that
          he/she has chosen when she registered. If all these fields are
          completed, the email is valid and the password has at least 8
          characters, a verification is made in the database to see if there
          is an user with the email provided and if the password matches. If
          all these steps are passed, the user will enter the webpage.

        <p>
          If an user doesn' t have an account, he/ she has to register. For
          that, the user has to provide a valid email adress and a password
          which should have at least 8 characters and to confirm the password.
          If the email is valid and it isn't been used by another user, also
          if the password has the necessary length and if the confirmPassword
          field matches with the password, the user is created. A message is
          shown for this and if there is any error, with any of these fields
          it shows an error which specifies exactly which is the problem. The
          password is stored crypted in the database. Both register and login
          are based on POST requests.

          There are two types of users for this webpage: a normal user and an
          administrator who can make some changes to the webpage from a
          dedicated page. We store this difference in the database through a
          field called "admin", which can be 0 or 1. I store the field admin
          in local storage and make the verification when somebody logs in.

          <h5><span>4.3.1 </span>User</h5>

          <p>
            An administrator can see in addition to all the things which a
            normal user can see, a page called " Admin page", from where he/
            she can check or uncheck the statistics which will appear. In this
            page there is a table with all the statistics for every type of
            data visualisation, which are checked firstly and if one statistic
            is unchecked, that statistic won' t appear anymore in the header,
            so the user can' t access it. First of all, I get all checkboxes
            and I put them in an HTMLCollection because that's what
            getElementsByTagName returns. Then I put in an object the key
            which is the id for every checkbox and the value which is the
            checked status( true for checked and false for unchecked). For
            every checkbox input I set the checked attribute depending on the
            values from the localstorage object (chartsToHide) or if there is
            no value for that id, it is true by default because we want to
            show the pages by default. Then for every element, when the
            checkbox is changed the value from the localstorage will also be
            changed. If a normal user wants to enter this admin page, he/ she
            will be redirected to the home page because he/ she doesn't have
            the rights to access it. For this it is verified in the
            localstorage if the field "admin" is 0 or 1.

      <h3>Statistics</h3>
      <p>
        Apax offers a variety of statistics comparing the numbers of cars
        present in each of the last 5 years in the national fleet. There are
        several criterias they can opt for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Number of cars by county and brand</li>
        <li>Number of cars by county and national category</li>
        <li>Number of cars by county and communitary category</li>
        <li>Number of total cars by county</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Moreover, Apax comes with a feature that lets the user see the number
        of cars for a specific year, in each county. This is also available
        for each of the relevant attribute described in the list above.
      </p>
      <p>
        For every statistic mentioned above, the application provides a page
        which the user can access from the navbar
      </p>

    <section id="visualisation">
      <h3>Data Visualisation</h3>
      <p>
        The <a href="#statistics">Statistics</a> mentioned above need to have
        a visualisation that is relevant to the user. That is why Apax comes
        with three types of charts and one cartographic way of visualisation.
        The charts are listed bellow as the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Pie Chart</li>
      </ul>
      <figure typeof="sa:image">
        <img src="../resources/pie_chart.png" alt="pie_chart" />
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Bar Chart</li>
      </ul>
      <figure typeof="sa:image">
        <img src="../resources/bar_chart.png" alt="bar_chart" />
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Line Chart (also known as Connected-Scatter)</li>
      </ul>
      <figure typeof="sa:image">
        <img src="../resources/line_chart.png" alt="line_chart" />
      </figure>

      <p>
        In order to implement the statistics, each of this way of data
        visualisation contains one or two select boxes, with the help of which
        the user can choose the values for the attributes they want to see.
        (By default, when the page is opened, the view is generated with the
        first values of each of the two select boxes.) In the case of charts,
        the first select button describes the county value, while the second
        one (if there is) describes the value of the chosen attribute.
      <figure typeof="sa:image">
        <img src="../resources/select_boxes_county.png" alt="select_boxes_county" />
      </figure>

      <p>
        For the cartographic visualisation, the only difference is that the
        first select button represents the year value.
      </p>
      <figure typeof="sa:image">
        <img src="../resources/select_boxes_year.png" alt="select_boxes_year" />
      </figure>
      <p>
        Every page that contains a chart and one or two selectboxes is rigurously built, starting with the first selectbox which describes
        the county or year value, which uses a GET request to take the information needed about the counties. Having that, the second selectbox
        can be build (also with a GET request), using the first value in the selectbox as a parameter, in order to display the brands,
        national or communitary category specific to it. Only after those two have been built, the chart can be generated making use of a
        GET request to an API endpoint that deals with counting cars that respect the two (or one) criterias.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="interactivity">
      <h4>Interactivity</h4>
      <p>
        Every data representation has an interactive element, called a
        tooltip. This is a small box that displays information about the
        data selected. Also, the colour changing effect when a certain part
        is selected, increases the feeling of interactive data
        visualisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, moving the mouse cursor over one of the rectangles in
        the bar chart will change their colour to a lighter shade and
        display the number of the cars respecting the two values selected in
        the selectbox (and the year that is abscissa value for the
        rectangle).
      </p>
      <figure typeof="sa:image">
        <img src="../resources/bar_chart_interactive.png" alt="bar_chart_interactive" />
      </figure>

      <p>
        In the case of line chart, there is no changing colour, but the
        circle increases its radius, and a tooltip appears with the same
        information as for the bar chart, once the cursor is over it.
      </p>
      <figure typeof="sa:image">
        <img src="../resources/line_chart_interactive.png" alt="line_chart_interactive" />
      </figure>

      <p>
        Pie chart fulfills its interactive aspect, having the colour of the
        "slices" changed when the cursor is over them, and, also, the
        tooltip appears, containing the information about the number of
        cars, and the percentage out of the total number of cars for the
        last 5 years.

      <p>
        Last but not least, the cartographic visualisation, which is the map
        of Romania split in counties, possesses the change-colour effect
        when a certain county is selected, and the tooltip effect, which
        contains the name of the county and the number of the cars found in
        that county.

      <h4>Updatability</h4>
      <p>
        Another quality of Apax's data visualisation is updatability (and
        the effects that come with it). Every chart or map we have mentioned
        has this feature. We will say exactly what it is all about in the
        following order:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Bar Chart - the bars go higher or lower, depending on the new
          values given. Moreover, the y axis updates itself with the
          correspondent numbers of cars
        </li>
        <li>
          Line Chart - the line, together with the circles, go higher or
          lower. Also, the y axis updates itself the same way it does at bar
          chart
        </li>
        <li>
          Pie Chart - the slices change their size, and, usually, their
          order changes too, from the biggest to the smallest
        </li>
        <li>
          Map - the colour shades of the counties represent a higher or a
          lower number of cars, compared to the minnimum value. Update means
          changing the shades of the colour.
        </li>
      </ul>
      As expected, the tooltip for each of these data visualisations is also
      updated with the new correspondent values. Every update takes place
      after the user selects the two values and presses the
      <b>Submit</b> button.

      </figure>
    </section>
    <section id="export">
      <h3>Data Export</h3>
      <p>
        Every way of data visualisation also has the option to export the data
        in different formats:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          CSV - the data is written, containing the attributes selected in
          that specific view and their values
        </li>
        <li>SVG - it saves the whole chart or map as a 2D image using XML</li>
        <li>
          WebP - an image format that compresses the original image data and
          represents it with a smaller size
        </li>
      </ul>
