            <h3><span>1. </span>Overview</h3>
            <p>Apax is a web application that lets the user see multiple statistics determined by different criteria.
                This is a guide of how to use this web application in terms of account managing, viewing statistics,
                interacting and updating them.
                Moreover, this guide includes the extra rights assigned to an administrator account.

        <section id="register">
            <h3><span>2. </span>Register</h3>
            <p>The first thing a new user has to do when entering the web application is to create a new account, also
                known as registering.
                This can be done very easily by providing an email and an eight-character long password. After doing
                this, the account will be saved
                as a normal user one and he/she will be redirected to the <a href="#login">Login Page</a>.

                the password correspondent to, and

            <h3><span>4. </span>Home Page</h3>
            <p>This is the page where it all begins, presenting the web application with a pretty design, but its most
                important element is the navigation bar.
                To find out more about how to use it, go to the <a href="#navbar">Navigation Bar</a> section below.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="navbar">
            <h4><span>5. </span>Navigation Bar</h4>
            <p>The purpose of the navigation bar is to help the user explore the statistics easily.
                Thus, there are two steps the user needs to pay attention to when making his/her choice, explained in
                the following sections.
            </p>
            <section id="way_of_viz">
                <h4><span>5.1. </span>Choose Way of Visualisation</h4>
                <p>As seen in the navigation bar, there are 4 types of data visualisation:
                <ul>
                    <li>Pie Chart - a type of graph in which a circle is divided into sectors that each represent a
                        proportion of the whole.</li>
                    <li>Bar Chart - a diagram in which the numerical values of variables are represented by the height
                        or length of lines or rectangles of equal width.</li>
                    <li>Line Chart - a diagram that displays the evolution of a numeric variable. Data points are
                        represented by a dot and connected by straight line segments.</li>
                    <li>Map Chart- a map divided into counties, coloured representatively depending on the values given.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Depending on how the user wants to see the information, he/she needs to pick one of the above.
                It is worthy to mention the fact that the first 3 help visualising the same information - number of cars
                per county and one other attribute of the cars found in the national fleet,
                which can be <i>brand</i>,<i>national category</i>, or <i>communitary category</i> for the last 5 years.
                Examples for each of them can be found below:
                <div id="chart_examples">
                    <figure typeof="sa:image">
                        <img src="resources/bar_chart_example.png" alt="bar_chart_example">
                        <figcaption>Bar Chart</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure typeof="sa:image">
                        <img src="resources/line_chart_example.png" alt="line_chart_example">
                        <figcaption>Line Chart</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure typeof="sa:image">
                        <img src="resources/pie_chart_example.png" alt="pie_chart_example">
                        <figcaption>Pie Chart</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                However, map chart represents data for all counties in a certain year with the same car attributes as in
                the previous three charts. So, if the user wants to see
                more like a geographical information than a historical one, he/she can opt for this chart. Below there
                is an example for the map chart:
                <figure typeof="sa:image">
                    <img src="resources/map_chart_example.png" alt="map_chart_example">
                    <figcaption>Bar Chart</figcaption>
                </figure>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="statistic">
                <h4><span>5.2. </span>Choose statistic</h4>
                <p>The second option the user needs to decide on is what type of statistic he/she wants to see. As
                    mentioned in the section above, bar chart, line chart, and pie chart
                    have the following statistics (for the last 5 years that appear in the National Fleet Website):
                <ul>
                    <li>county and brand - number of cars in a certain county that are part of a brand</li>
                    <li>county and national category - number of cars in a certain county that are part of
                        a national category</li>
                    <li>county and communitary category- number of cars in a certain county that are part
                        of a communitary category</li>
                    <li>county - total number of cars in a certain county</li>
                </ul>
                On the other hand, the user can opt for a statistic from the following (from the map chart, for each
                county of Romania):
                <ul>
                    <li>year and brand - number of cars that are part of a brand in a certain year</li>
                    <li>year and national category - number of cars that are part of a national category in a certain
                        year</li>
                    <li>year and communitary category - number of cars that are part of a communitary category in a
                        certain year</li>
                </ul>
                Once the user chooses a statistic, too, the new page loads with a chart generated by the first values of
                the two selectboxes. After this,
                he/she can enjoy the interaction it provides.

        <section id="interaction">
            <h3><span>6. </span>Interaction with Statistics</h3>
            <p>
                What would a data visualisation be without interaction? That is why every chart has its own way of
                interacting with the user, making it easier for him/her to see the data. An important action the user
                should make is using the cursor to go over the elements found in the respective chart. This will cause
                different actions, depending on the type of data visualisation:
            <ol>
                <li>The rectangles in the bar chart will change their colour
                    to a lighter shade and display the number of the cars respecting the two values selected in the
                    selectbox

                <li>The circles of the line chart increase their radius, and a

                    total
                    number of cars for the last 5 years.

                    number
                    of the cars found in that county that respect the second attribute selected by the user.

            <p>
                If the user wants to change the statistic criteria he/she can modify the values of the selectboxes found
                on the page.
            <figure typeof="sa:image">
                <img src="resources/selectbox_modify.png" alt="selectbox_modify">
                <figcaption>Changing selectbox value.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            After doing that, he/she can press the <i>Submit</i> button in order to generate the new chart. After doing
            so, the update effect will take place,
            being different for each of the charts:
            <ul>
                <li>Bar Chart - the bars go higher or lower, depending on the new values given. Moreover, the y axis
                    updates
                    itself with the correspondent numbers of cars</li>
                <li>Line Chart - the line, together with the circles, go higher or lower. Also, the y axis updates
                    itself the
                    same way it does at bar chart</li>
                <li>Pie Chart - the slices change their size, and, usually, their order changes too, from the biggest to
                    the
                    smallest</li>
                <li>Map - the colour shades of the counties represent a higher or a lower number of cars, compared to
                    the
                    minnimum value. Update means changing the shades of the colour.</li>
            </ul>
            As expected, the tooltip for each of these data visualisations is also updated with the new correspondent
            values.

            <section id="export">
                <h3><span>8. </span>Data Export</h3>
                <p>
                    Another feature the user can enjoy is data exportation. Each of the charts presented can be exported
                    in 3 formats:
                <ul>
                    <li>CSV - the data is written, containing the attributes selected in that specific view and their
                        values</li>
                    <li>SVG - it saves the whole chart or map as a 2D image using XML</li>
                    <li>WebP - an image format that compresses the original image data and represents it with a smaller
                        size</li>
                </ul>
                All the user has to do is to press one of the three buttons below the chart (one for each format) and
                the file will
                be downloaded.

        <section id="administrator">
            <h3><span>9. </span>Administrator</h3>
            <p>
                The functionalities mentioned above are avaialable for both normal users and the ones with administrator
                privileges. However, there is
                a thing needed to be added here: the normal user can only see the statistics that the administrator lets
                him/her see. That is the feature
                implemented for the administration module. Thus, the administrator disposes of a page with options to be
                checked or unchecked, like in the following
                image:
            <figure typeof="sa:image">
                <img src="resources/checkbox_admin.png" alt="checkbox_admin">
            </figure>
            Once a statistic for a certain way of visualisation is unchecked by the administrator, it cannot be seen by
            a normal user. The opposite is available, too:
            once a statistic is checked, it can be seen by the user.
